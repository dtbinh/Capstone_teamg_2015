# These specify the public parameters and their default values. These
# should also be reflected as args with their respective defaults in the launcher.
# The app manager checks against these and denies/accepts incoming parameters
# received when calling the start_rapp service. They also get used as idl info
# for the rapp.
#
# Note: it is easier and more reliable to have them set here in yaml than have to parse
# and extract information from arg tags in the launcher.
